# Student Result Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of student results to explore how different factors influence academic performance. The analysis includes:
- Distribution of gender and ethnic groups
- Impact of parental education on student scores
- Effect of parental marital status on academic performance
- Identification of outliers in scores

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drona-gyawali/Student-Result-Analysis/main/Student_Result%20Analysis.csv).

## Key Findings
- **Gender Distribution**: There are more female students than male students in the dataset.
- **Parental Education**: Higher parental education levels correlate with higher student scores.
- **Parental Marital Status**: Parental marital status has a negligible impact on student scores.
- **Ethnic Group Distribution**: Visual representation of the distribution of students among different ethnic groups.

## Analysis and Visualization
The project includes various plots and visualizations to represent the data:
- Count plots for gender and ethnic group distribution
- Heatmaps to show the relationship between parental education and student scores
- Boxplots to identify outliers in Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Pie charts for the distribution of ethnic groups

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the analysis and visualizations

## Conclusion
The analysis concludes that parental education has a direct impact on student academic performance, while parental marital status shows negligible impact. The visualizations help in identifying patterns and outliers in the data.
